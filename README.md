# Georgia Trade Dynamics 2023: Export-Import Analysis

This project provides insights into the country's exports and imports during the period of January to November 2023, offering a detailed examination of trade trends.
It aims to identify top trading partners and analyze their share in the country's market.
<br /><br />
The data is collected from [The Ministry of Finance of Georgia](https://www.mof.ge/en/)'s website and is publicly accessible (though I made a slight modification, translating it from Georgian to English).
